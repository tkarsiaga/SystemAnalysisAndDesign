# SystemAnalysisAndDesign
SNHU 
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project.
The DriverPass project is developement of a software progam that will give individuals the opportunity to take classes online to obtain theyre drivers license experience. 
Who was the client?
The owner of DriversPass Iam is the primary client on this project. He is the owner.  
What type of system did they want you to design?
The system they want designed is simular to that of an online school that offers learning materials, progress tracking, and access to schedule appointments with driving instructors. This software is to be connected to the DMV network as to stay updated with the regulations and updated learning materials approved for such a coarse. 
What did you do particularly well?
I felt that the section that I did my best work on was when creating the diagrams, I also enjoyed creating UML diagrams that expose the objects, their attributes, and methods that will use the data. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to revise the interface portion of the business requirement documentation. I also struggled with the limitations and assumptions. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? 
My interpretation of the users needs was kept as basic and general as I could keep it. Simplicity was used to form the foundation of the DriversPass software, leaving plenty of room for the details to be added during each step of the SDLC. 
Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The importance of considering the user's needs when designing is if you know the type of audience or user the program will be hosting, it makes it easier to map out the type of process thats needed to implement the program successfuly. For example, if the software was made for a kindergarden class, it would be necessary to have an interface that will appeal to and be user friendly for that age group. 
How do you approach designing software?
The agile approach in design would be my choice due to the testing and project developement are done simutaniously and work hand in hand with all the team memebers. Updates and improvements are implemented during the process of development as opposed to waiting until developement is complete and going back to correct.
One technigque I would choose to use is creating the Use Case Diagram and timeline of project task. I believe that would be best for creating deadlines and order of task importance as well team assignment.
